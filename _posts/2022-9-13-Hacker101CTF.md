# Hacker101 CTF

# A little something to get you started

## Difficulty

Trivial

## Start

Start the challenge and then access to the web. We will see a simple html page. Ctrl+ U to view source and we can see a file name `background.png` . Try to access to this file with URL: `/background.png` , and then we got the flag.

# Micro-CMS v1

## Difficulty

Easy

## Start

In this challenge, we have to find 4 flags. After start challenge and access to this web app, we know that the main function of this web app is create and edit markdown web page.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%201.png)

As you can see, if we visit any page, the url above  will change with format `/page/{index-of-pages}` . So i create apage, and recognize that the index of my page is 11.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%202.png)

So i try to change the number from 3 to 10 (because number 1 and 2 is the default page). From 3 to 10 except 5, i got 404  Not Found responses.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%203.png)

But when i change the URL to `/page/5` i got 403 Forbidden

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%204.png)

So i think may be the flag is in page 5.

When i use the edit function, the URL is `/page/edit/{index-of-pages}` . We can see the URL is same as URL of page. I think may be we can see content of page 5 if we use edit function. So i replace `{index-of-pages}` with 5. And i got the first flag.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%205.png)

The next flag, i founded it through checking the hints. The hints told me to check other types of vulneralbility like XSS, SQLi, … So i checked all of them.

While checking XSS, i recognized that this page could have Stored XSS if we submitted an XSS payload at title field

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%206.png)

And then return to the home page, where the tittle appeared, the XSS payload will be triggered. Because of that thought, i try some payload but it’s not working. Then i remember that `markdown is supported` so i try this payload: 

```jsx
<script>alert`1`</script> 
```

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%207.png)

After return to the home page, its worked!!!

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%208.png)

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%209.png)

We got the 2nd flag.

After that, i try to expolit SQLi

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2010.png)

When i add a single `‘`,nothing happen. But when i use the URL: `/page/edit` , it does.

 

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2011.png)

And we have the 3rd flag. I can do those things because a use many hints from challenge :’(.

By read the hint for the last flag, i solved it. 

Notice that in the Markdown Test page, we had a submit button, we can add an event call `onclick` to trigger XSS.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2012.png)

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2013.png)

Inspect that button and we got the last flag.

## Hints

### Flag1

# Postbook

## Difficulty

Easy

## Hints

### Flag 0

• The person with username "user" has a very easy password...

### Flag 1

• Try viewing your own post and then see if you can change the ID

### Flag 2

• You should definitely use "Inspect Element" on the form when creating a new post

### Flag 3

• 189 * 5

### Flag 4

• You can edit your own posts, what about someone else's?

### Flag 5

• The cookie allows you to stay signed in. Can you figure out how they work so you can sign in to user with ID 1?

### Flag 6

• Deleting a post seems to take an ID that is not a number. Can you figure out what it is?

## Start

Start challenge and access to the website. We will know some fucntion of this web app.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2014.png)

And if you want to use these function, you must login. So i signup an account with username and password are: `a/a` and then login.

After login, we will see the main page of webapp,

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2015.png)

As you can see, this webapp has these function: write a new post, view profile, Settings and view other’s public posts. We had 2 public posts of 2 authors name ‘user’ and ‘admin’.

Check the first hint, maybe the user name ‘user’ has a weak password, after a several time of trying sumbit some different password, i founded out that user’s password is ‘password’ and we got the first flag.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2016.png)

Click my post and notice that the URL has parameter `id` with value is 3. So i think maybe this is IDOR vulneralbility. I change value of `id` to 2 and BOOM. We got 2nd flag.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2017.png)

User write a new post function and inspect, we can see a hidden input tag with param `name` is user_id and value =3, so i try to change the value and got the 3rd flag.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2018.png)

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2019.png)

Next, recognize that we can change the id parameter to any value we want. And the hint: `189*5` , so i change the id’s value to 945 and got the flag

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2020.png)

We have another idor at edit post function. We can edit other post if we change the id parameter

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2021.png)

Click save post and we got the flag.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2022.png)

Check the cookie and regconized that the cookie value seem like an md5 hash

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2023.png)

The cookie value is id hashed.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2024.png)

Replace cookie value with md5(1) and we are admin 

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2025.png)

Use function delete post and intercept the request using burp proxy.

Regconized that the id isvalue of md5 hashed.

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2026.png)

Change the value with other post’s id and hash it

![Untitled](/assets/img/img-wu/Hacker101CTF/Untitled%2027.png)

And we got the last flag.
